**Explanation of Working**:

To simulate the store, please right-click **pom.xml**, 
choose **"Add as Maven Project"** first,
and then run **src/main/java/RunStore.java**

We simulate 30 days of the Store's running.

We have the **Item** class which is the abstract class that every item in our inventory
inherits its attributes from.

The clerk actions are present in the **Clerk** class. The happenings at the store, which are related to the
items and days and the rotation of the clerks are handled in the **Store** class.

For getting common global functionality we make use of **Constants.java** and **Helper.java**.
Both of which are static classes.

**JUnit tests**:

To run the JUnit tests, please run **src/test/java/StoreTest.java**

**Project 2 Notes and Comments**:

Between Part 1 of this project and Part 2, we had to update our UML class diagram
to reflect changes we made to the class structure once we had a better
idea of how to implement all the required Objects and their corresponding behaviors.

We have another file for showing you all the details about it:<br>
https://github.com/addzy94/ooad-project-team/blob/master/Updated_UML_Diagram.txt
