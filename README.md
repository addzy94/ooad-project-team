Explanation of Working:

To simulate the store, please run **src/RunStore.java**

We simulate 30 days of the Store's running.

We have the **Item** class which is the abstract class that every item in our inventory
inherits its attributes from.

The clerk actions are present in the **Clerk** class. The happenings at the store, which are related to the
items and days and the rotation of the clerks are handled in the **Store** class.

For getting common global functionality we make use of **Constants.java** and **Helper.java**.
Both of which are static classes.

Object-Oriented Approach :
    INHERITANCE - Clerk.java - Line 7
    ENCAPSULATION - Item.java - Line 4
    ABSTRACTION - Item.java - Line 21
    COHESION - Clerk.java - Line 24
    IDENTITY - Store.java - Line 40
    POLYMORPHISM - Store.java - Line 113

Project 2 Notes and Comments:

Between Part 1 of this project and Part 2, we had to update our UML class diagram
to reflect changes we made to the class structure once we had a better
idea of how to implement all the required Objects and their corresponding behaviors.<br>
We have another file for showing you all the details about it: https://github.com/addzy94/ooad-project-team/blob/master/Updated_UML_Diagram.txt
